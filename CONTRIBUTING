# Contributing to the Code
- Follow the existing code style when making changes or adding new code.
- Add code typing, more is better than less.
- Indent with 2 spaces, no tab, and use Unix line endings.
- If modifying the code requires a hack, avoid making the change.

## Vue3 and Nuxt3
- Use the option API when possible.
- Avoid using the store in low-level components to make them easier to manipulate and test.

# Testing
- Include tests with any changes made.
- Add Histoire stories for new components or when modifying existing ones.
- Maintain and add Cypress tests for new features.

# Contributing on GitHub
- Split changes into coherent commits, ensuring that the commit comments and messages remain readable for years.
- Only include one fix or feature per PR. If the feature is large, split it into multiple PRs.
